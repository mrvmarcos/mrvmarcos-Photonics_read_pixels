## Summary

This repository contains the resources and code for a laboratory session dedicated to studying the principles of interference and diffraction. These fundamental phenomena in wave optics are crucial for understanding light behavior.

- **Images:** Collection of photos used in the experiments.
- **Python Script:** Code for reading photos, extracting specific pixels, and performing conversions.
- **Theory Document:** Detailed document compiling the theoretical background.

### Laboratory Overview

In this laboratory session, the principles of interference and diffraction are studied. Interference occurs when waves overlap, resulting in either reinforcement or cancellation of amplitudes, generating distinctive patterns. Diffraction involves wave bending around obstacles or through narrow openings, producing diffraction patterns. By analyzing these patterns, the wavelength of light can be deduced.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Interference:** Superposition of waves leading to reinforcement or cancellation.
- **Diffraction:** Wave bending around obstacles or through narrow openings.

### Goals

The objectives of this lab session are:
- Measure the wavelength of a laser with a diffraction slit wheel.
- Measure the wavelength of a Hydrogen Lamp and a LED lamp with a grating lines diffractor.

#### Theoretical Framework

The study includes the application of the superposition principle for interference and the Fraunhofer diffraction equation:

\[ d \cdot \sin(\theta) = d \cdot \frac{y}{\sqrt{y^2 + x^2}} = m \cdot \lambda \]

where:
- \( d \) is the slit spacing
- \( \theta \) is the diffraction angle
- \( m \) is the diffraction maximum
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of light

For simplicity, \( m=1 \) is used, requiring only one calculation for the sine with trigonometry.

Additionally, the ratio of the widths of the central diffraction peak to the central interference fringe is expressed as:

\[ \frac{2a}{b} \]

where \( a/b \) is the ratio of slit separation to slit width.
